# Matt-Carroll-Muscian
A portfolio website for singer songwriter Matt Carroll.

This was the first website I designed and built. I spoke to Matthew about what he wanted from a website, he asked for something that would show case his work and advertise his new music material. 

The website is a single page and uses media queries for a responsive design. Javascript enables the user to click buttons to see different playlists and watch a variety of videos of Matthew performing.
