# Matt-Carroll-Musician
A portfolio website for singer songwriter Matt Carroll.

This was the first website I created. I spoke to Matthew about what he wanted from a website, he asked for something that would show case his work and advertise new music material.

This is a sing page website which uses media queries for a responsive design. Different playlists can be viewed by clicking on the playlist buttons. Videos of Matthew performing are embedded into the website and can be viewed by clicking the video buttons. I used Adobe Photoshop to edit the photo of Matthew's album cover.
